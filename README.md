# ðŸŽ¯ Goal Setter

## Project Description

**Goal Setter** is a simple and interactive React + Redux app that lets users set personal goals with start and target dates. It offers a clean UI, filtering for completed/incomplete goals, and subtle animations using Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS.

**Goal Setter allows users to:**
- Add a new goal with a title, start date, and target date
- Mark goals as completed
- Edit existing goals
- Filter between all, completed, and incomplete goals

**This project uses:**
- **React** for building UI components
- **Redux Toolkit** for managing global state
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Vite** as the front-end tooling for fast development
